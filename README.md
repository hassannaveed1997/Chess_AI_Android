It makes use of a minimax algorithm using alpha beta pruning, default depth is 3 to keep it low on resources and easy, but it can easily handle depths of 5 or even 6. Performs pretty well.

Note: it does not have advanced features such as pawns transforming at the end or castling. All code is self written or generated through android studio
